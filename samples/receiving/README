This is a sample Django app which demonstrates how to receive Mailgun-routed 
emails via HTTP POST

Installation
------------

> pip install django
> cd receiving
> ./start-server.sh


Setup
-----

Set up your routes in urls.py:

One for receiving parsed messages (nice):
    (r'mime$', 'receiving.callback.views.upload_mime')  

One for receiving MIME messages, if you want to do your own MIME parsing:
    (r'.*', 'receiving.callback.views.upload')

So you should have two urls now, ready to be used as destinations for Mailgun routes:

http://yourdomain.com/upload_mime
http://yourdomain.com/upload    

Usage
-----
First, look at callbacks/views.py to see how messages are being received
Then set up a route in your mailgun account to forward mail to either of these two URLs:
    http://your-server.com:8000/upload
    http://your-server.com:8000/upload_mime
